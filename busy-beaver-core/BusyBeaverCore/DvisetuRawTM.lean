# Dvisetu raw Turing-machine semantics and conditional closure

Bare-Lean model of the concrete BB(6) machine

`1RB0RB_1LB0LC_1RD1LC_1RE0RA_0RF1RA_---1LB`  (Dvisetu, dossier-6: the
one-hole two-counter machine).

Checked statements (no sorry, no extra axioms):

* `step_eq_none_iff` — the machine halts in one step exactly at the unique
  undefined transition `F0`.
* `into_F_only_from_E0` — state `F` is entered only via `E` reading `0`
  (the transition `E0 = 0RF`: write `0`, move right).
* `halt_requires_e_probe_00` — any raw halt from a non-`F` start passes
  through a reachable configuration in state `E` reading `0` whose *right*
  neighbour is also `0`.
* `nonhalting_of_e_probe_safe` / `blank_nonhalting_of_e_probe_safe` — the
  E-probe-safety invariant ("every 0 that state E reads has a 1 to its
  right") implies the machine never halts.
* episode theorems (`passA_step`, `passE_step`, `drift_step`,
  `renew2_step`, `collapse_step`, `micro_step`) — the exact validated
  choreography of the timed abstract map of 2026-09-02: drift
  `(a, b) → (a+4, b-3)` in `(32b-41)/3` steps, collapse `(a, 1) → (a+3)`
  in 5, micro `(m) → (m+1)` in 1, and the two linear renewal branches.
* the abstract checkpoint orbit `corbit` / `cstep` with transport
  theorems, and the keystone `safeDvisetuOrbit_nonhalting`:
  `SafeCheckpointOrbit → ¬ RawHalts blankStart`.

`SafeCheckpointOrbit` is the conjunction of (i) the checkpoint conjecture
— the timed abstract orbit from the startup anchor never leaves its
guards — and (ii) `DivideFaithful`, the assumption that the recursive
divide renewal branch (`n ≡ 0 (mod 3)`, quadratic-time, validated on all
raw events to `n = 2,976` but not yet given an episode proof) realizes
its abstract output on the tape.  Both components are exactly the
empirical substrate of the dossier-6 law set (2,746/2,746 record
transitions exact at 20M raw steps); everything else in this file is
proven unconditionally.

/-- Halt localization: from any non-`F` start, a raw halt forces a reachable
configuration where `E` reads a `0` whose right neighbour is also `0`.

Informally: *to die, the machine must first stand in state `E` on a `0`
with another `0` immediately to its right* — because the only door into
the halting state `F` is the transition `E0`, which writes the `0` back
and steps right, so the cell `F` then dies on was already `0` when `E`
probed.  An unbounded question ("does it ever halt?") becomes the
reachability of a two-cell pattern. -/
