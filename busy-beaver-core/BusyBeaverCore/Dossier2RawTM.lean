# Dossier-2 raw semantics and halt localization

Bare-Lean model of the BB(6) holdout
`1RB1RC_1LC1LC_1RE0LD_1LB1RF_---1RA_0RD1RD` (stage757: exact orbit spec).

* halt in one step exactly at the undefined `E0`;
* state `E` is entered only via `C0` (write 1, move right);
* any raw halt passes through a reachable `C`-probe of a `00` pattern
  (the probed 0's RIGHT neighbour is also 0);
* `CProbeSafe blankStart → ¬ RawHalts blankStart` — the contract the
  machine's (future) certified orbit must discharge.
